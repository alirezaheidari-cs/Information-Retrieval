# Information Retrieval System

## Phase 1

In Phase 1 of this project, an Information Retrieval system has been developed. The system focuses on processing a dataset consisting of papers, including paperId, title, and abstract. The first step involved implementing a positional index, facilitating efficient searching and retrieval of information. Vector space scoring models, including 'ltn-lnn,' 'ltc-lnc,' and 'okapi25,' were implemented to rank and score documents based on their relevance to user queries. Spell correction methods utilizing a bigram index were incorporated to enhance search accuracy. The system's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Precision, Recall, F1 score, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). This phase establishes the foundation for subsequent stages of the project, ensuring robust and accurate retrieval of relevant papers while providing insights into the search engine's effectiveness.

## Phase 2

In Phase 2 of this project, a system for document classification has been implemented. Various techniques were employed to classify documents effectively. Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier, was utilized to categorize documents based on their features. A neural network trained on the TF-IDF vectorized representation of documents was implemented to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. Additionally, a pretrained BERT language model was employed to leverage its contextual understanding for accurate classification. To further explore document relationships, clustering methods such as K-means and Hierarchical Clustering were incorporated, enabling the grouping of similar documents based on their characteristics. This phase enhances the document organization and retrieval capabilities of the system, facilitating efficient information retrieval and analysis.

## Phase 3

Phase 3 of this project focuses on enhancing the Information Retrieval system with additional functionalities. Firstly, a crawler was implemented to gather data from the Semantic Scholar site, acquiring approximately 2000 papers' information. Next, various methods were integrated to improve search relevance and user experience. The PageRank algorithm was employed to rank papers based on their importance and authority within the citation network. A personalized search was implemented, allowing users to receive search results tailored to their favorite papers. The Ranking Authors with Hit algorithm was utilized to identify influential authors based on their citation impact. Furthermore, a recommender system was developed, incorporating both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based algorithms to provide personalized paper recommendations. Finally, a simple user interface (UI) was designed to facilitate easy access and utilization of the complete search engine. This phase enhances the overall functionality and user satisfaction, making the system a comprehensive tool for efficient paper search, ranking, and recommendation.
